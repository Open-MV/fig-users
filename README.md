## Description of FIG Users

The Users Foundational Interest Group (FIG) is focused on fostering open source and standards to support user-focused objects. In addition to enabling elements related to user-focused objects, this work also focuses on the relationship of user-focused objects with other objects and systems—specifically, how these user-focused objects process other data objects, and how other data objects consume user-focused objects.
See the [FIG's charter](governance/FIG-Charter.md) for full details.

## What does the Foundational Interest Group do?

* Digital IDs where the identity of a user or external agent can refer to a person, organization, software application, hardware or virtual device. These carry relationships with other services to enable the automation and mediation for the use of other objects. These include the creation, activation, deactivation and possible deletion of the user objects.
* How and which trusted models may work best when traversing unrelated services and systems, which can help provide a more seamless experience when interacting in the Metaverse.
* Understanding and extending legacy centralized identity systems and where decentralized systems can and should be used on a massive scale. This includes Decentralized Identifiers and how they may be used, including endpoints, documents or objects that are targeted by DIDs.
* The authentication of verifiable credentials along with the communication and exchange protocols. How these can be used and what elements are exposed with the proper selective disclosure of information.
* If, how and where distributed ledger networks are used for user objects and DIDs within a Zero Trust approach to security.
* Build models of objects like DIDs, verifiable credentials with the communication and exchange protocols that can create a trusted digital relationship for unrelated services.
* How the logistics of digital wallets with various target objects can be managed and related to user data objects.
* Where social graphs and n-tier relationships can be created and utilized with many services where user permissions may be granted or denied.
* To help define a contextual model that may be queried and applied for various experiences. For example, a stadium with 100k people, who will you actually see?
* Define a model of credibility and presence for the user and their existence in and outside of their networks with given user permissions.
* Provide a possible model where selective data may be queried to enable curation of content specific to the user.

### Who can attend or participate?

The OMF cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. You do not need anyone’s permission to get involved and contribute to the project. The #artificial-intel channel on OMF Discord is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the GitHub Discussions area which need your input.
